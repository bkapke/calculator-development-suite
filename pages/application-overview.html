<h2>The Application</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    Modern web applications perform every function under the sun, but the all have fairly common principles.  For the
    testing portion of this demonstration we will need to have an app that matches the basic requirement of modern web
    applications.  For now lets say that most apps do the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Applications display content.</li>
    <li>They accept user input via various input types and forms.</li>
    <li>Based on the subsequent user interaction, most apps provide feedback and results to the user accordingly.</li>
    <li>Feedback can come in the form of alerts, redirection, or dom manipulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    For the purposes of this demo we will use a basic calculator as our application.  Keep in mind, this is <strong>NOT</strong> a tutorial on how
    to build a web based calculator.  However, performing some simple calculations based on user input and updating the UI
    accordingly, is a simple way to demonstrate some advanced development practices.
